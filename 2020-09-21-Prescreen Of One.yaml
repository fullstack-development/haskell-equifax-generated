    # Introduction
      
      Equifax’s Prescreen of One is a sales tool that is intended to entice the consumer to take a step toward opening a credit or loan account. Lenders can make offers of credit or insurance, in real time, in person or over the phone.

    # Promoting to UAT
    
    To successfully submit test transactions through your application in the UAT environment, a test member number is required.  You may use your existing Equifax test member number(s).  Please contact your Equifax Account Representative if a new test member number is needed. The steps below can be used to test in the UAT environment.
    
    Transactions generated using a test member number do not return identical results as a sandbox transaction.  A sandbox transaction will reflect everything that is exposed in the API whereas a test member number is configured to align with the specifications of your contract. Please contact us to ensure your test member number is configured to your expectations.

                  This indicator may appear on the report for various reasons, such as:
                  
                   - The system encountered a condition where a father/son, brother/brother, or non‐related consumer/consumer files have been mixed by applying a consumer's data to the wrong file.
                   
                   - When a fraud indicator (Q, R, T or V) is placed on the file, the Do Not Combine indicator is placed on the file to avoid the file from combining with a file that may have been created as a result of fraud.

                      Consumers or their representatives may request that an Initial Fraud Alert or, if the consumer is a member of the military on active duty, an Active Duty Alert be placed on their credit file. The Initial Fraud Alert will remain on the credit file for one year (366 days); the Active Duty Alert will remain on file for twelve months. Equifax will return an “N”, “Q”, or “V”, as applicable, in the Header segment.
                      
                      A user receiving a report containing an Initial Fraud Alert or Active Duty Alert may not grant credit without first determining the identity of the person making the request. If the consumer has provided a telephone number, it will be returned in a second Consumer Narrative Statement segment or Alert Contact segment and must be used for identity verification purposes before granting credit.

                          Indicator is for identity fraud risk alert purposes only and is not
                          to be used for determining an individual’s eligibility
                          for any credit or any other FCRA permissible
                          purpose. Client shall use the [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] 
                          exclusively within Client’s own organization
                          for the purpose of identity fraud prevention. 
                          Accordingly, Client will not use an alert
                          or warning message from the [SYNTHETIC ID
                          ALERT] system in its decision-making process for
                          denying credit, but will use the message as an
                          indication that the consumer's identity and
                          personally identifiable information should be
                          independently verified to form a reasonable belief
                          that it knows the true identity of the consumer.
                          Client understands that the information supplied by
                          [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] may or may not apply to
                          the consumer who has applied to Client for credit,
                          service, dealings, or other financial transactions.
                          Client also understands and agrees that data from
                          the [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] system is proprietary
                          to Equifax and shall not be used as a component of
                          any database or file built or maintained by
                          Client. The use of such data shall be limited to the

                          ALERT] message is provided. Equifax may, by
                          written notice to Client, immediately terminate the
