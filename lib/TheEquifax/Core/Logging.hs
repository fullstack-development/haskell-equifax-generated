   Prescreen of One

   # Introduction      Equifaxâ€™s Prescreen of One is a sales tool that is intended to entice the consumer to take a step toward opening a credit or loan account. Lenders can make offers of credit or insurance, in real time, in person or over the phone.    # Getting Started  1. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Create</a>** an application  2. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>** to Prescreen of One API  3. **<a href=\"/products/consumer-credit-report\" target=\"_blank\">Explore</a>** the Sandbox environment  # Promoting to UAT  To successfully submit test transactions through your application in the UAT environment, a test member number is required.  You may use your existing Equifax test member number(s).  Please contact your Equifax Account Representative if a new test member number is needed. The steps below can be used to test in the UAT environment.  Transactions generated using a test member number do not return identical results as a sandbox transaction.  A sandbox transaction will reflect everything that is exposed in the API whereas a test member number is configured to align with the specifications of your contract. Please contact us to ensure your test member number is configured to your expectations.      1. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Promote</a>** application to test  2. **<a href=\"/documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Update</a>** requests details for UAT  3. **<a href=\"/documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Test</a>** scenarios in UAT environment   # For More Details    * **<a href=\"/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Us</a>** - Equifax Developer Center Support Website   * **ACRO Migration Support**       * phone: 1-888-407-0359; Option 2 followed by Option 5         * email:  BT.Acro.tech@equifax.com
