  description: "# Introduction \n  \n  Equifax’s Consumer Credit Report is the leading\
    \ consumer credit resource enabling lenders to make faster, more informed credit-granting\
    \ decisions, better manage their risk and maximize growth opportunities. The Consumer\
    \ Credit Report unites the power of superior consumer dfata with best-in-class\
    \ search and match logic capabilities to deliver higher match rates on more inquiries.\n\
    \  \n# Getting Started\n\n1. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\"\
    >Create</a>** an application\n\n2. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"\
    _blank\">Subscribe</a>** to Consumer Credit Report API\n\n3. **<a href=\"/products/consumer-credit-report\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">Explore</a>** the Sandbox environment\nmode\n# Promoting to\
    \ UAT\n\nTo successfully submit test transactions through your application in\
    \ the UAT environment, a test member number is required.  You may use your existing\
    \ Equifax test member number(s).  Please contact your Equifax Account Representative\
    \ if a new test member number is needed. The steps below can be used to test in\
    \ the UAT environment.\n\nTransactions generated using a test member number do\
    \ not return identical results as a sandbox transaction.  A sandbox transaction\
    \ will reflect everything that is exposed in the API whereas a test member number\
    \ is configured to align with the specifications of your contract. Please contact\
    \ us to ensure your test member number is configured to your expectations.   \

            The following indicator codes can be returned in the Header segment:
               - N: Active Duty Alert
               - Q: Active Duty Alert with Fraud Victim “Initial Alert”
               - R: Active Duty Alert with Fraud Victim T (police report)

               - W: Active Duty Alert with Fraud Victim “Extended Alert”
               - X: Fraud Victim “Extended Alert”

            Consumers or their representatives may request that an Initial Fraud Alert or, if the consumer is a member of the military on active duty, an Active Duty Alert be placed on their credit file. The Initial Fraud Alert will remain on the credit file for one year (366 days); the Active Duty Alert will remain on file for twelve months. Equifax will return an “N”, “Q”, or “V”, as applicable, in the Header segment.
            A user receiving a report containing an Initial Fraud Alert or Active Duty Alert may not grant credit without first determining the identity of the person making the request. If the consumer has provided a telephone number, it will be returned in a second Consumer Narrative Statement segment or Alert Contact segment and must be used for identity verification purposes before granting credit.
